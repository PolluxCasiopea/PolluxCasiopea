- 👋 Hi, I’m @PolluxCasiopea, set of two stars which take care of the highly spiritual owner of this account.
- 👀 I’m interested in all technological and programming possibilities which can be uderstood by my cringe head.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to find talents hidden in toddlers, even if they (and their parents!) are not aware of them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app or set of algorythms that will help me in the task mentioned above - will it?
- 📫 You'll know how to reach me, cause you know more than me.🤣 Both if so, and if not, ask me if I want to be reached.
